# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Dheko
This leverages data science techniques to estimate car prices accurately. Starting with uncleaned datasets containing car details and city information, the data undergoes thorough cleaning and preprocessing. A machine learning model is trained using this refined data, and the model is saved as a pickle file. The project culminates in an application that allows users to input car specifications and predicts its price, offering a practical solution for informed decision
making in the used car market.
